# SMASH Visualization

The SMASH graphs produced by the `smash` program are not ideal for publication, especially considering we would like to highlight areas of interest which is not a supported feature of the builtin figure generation.

This Nextflow script and associated code utilize the raw data used by `smash` to produce more refined and modifiable graphs via `conda`, `R`, and `ggplot2`.

## Dependencies

This workflow has been designed such that only `nextflow` and `conda` should be necessary -- all other dependencies are setup as needed.

```console
$ nextflow -version
