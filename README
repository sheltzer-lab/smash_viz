# Plan

On 2022-06/27, Jason requested I take one of the SMASH graphs from the shared Dropbox and highlight the relevant chromosome in light blue. For A2780 MDM4 C13, that chromosome is 1q. Once done, share this image on Dropbox.

## Notes

- `smash_viz.py` is designed to modify PostScript files and apply highlighting
- `smash_viz.R` is designed to read the SMASH data (results txt files) and produce equivalent plots with highlighting
